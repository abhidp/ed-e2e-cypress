* All Tests that involve interacting with the prismic part of the Website are excluded. This is because the prismic part of the Website is handled by marketing team and `ed` monorepo does not involve any code related to prismic. Marketing can change webisite's prismic components anytime without notice which will result in E2E failures on `ed` pipelines and block other developers. Hence we agreed to remove all E2E tests for which the src code in not in `ed` repo in this slack thread: https://safetyculture.slack.com/archives/C03V66YSPR6/p1662075978348009
